# ambientgenerator
A Max/MSP project that allows the user to create and generate drones and ambiences for visual media.


To use this project, you do not need to own Max 8. I hope you find it useful and fun in any way; whether on its own or in conjunction with other visual media!

Follow the instructions on the GUI to use the application. If you wish to record the audio results, then route the audio output by double-clicking the ~dac object to the right of the EQ object and use an external program or DAW to record. If you do not possess such a program then consider downloading freeware such as audacity or OBS to record the audio.
