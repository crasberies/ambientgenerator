Follow the instructions on the GUI to use the application. If you wish to record the audio results, then route the audio output by double-clicking the ~dac object to the right of the EQ object and use an external program or DAW to record. If you do not possess such a program then consider downloading freeware such as audacity or OBS to record the audio.
